# Project Context for AI Cover Letter Ethiopia

This document provides essential context for the next developer agent continuing work on this project. It outlines the recent changes, the rationale behind them, and establishes clear guidelines for future development.

## Project State & Recent Developments

The project is a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend. The core features are functionally complete. The most recent development cycle focused heavily on improving the User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) by adding professional, modern animations and loading states.

The primary goal of these changes was to make the application feel more responsive, polished, and professional, reducing perceived loading times and providing better visual feedback to the user.

## Key Files & Modifications

### Core Technology Added
- **`framer-motion`**: This library was added to the frontend dependencies (`frontend/package.json`) to handle all new animations. It was chosen for its power, ease of use, and integration with React.

### Components
- **`frontend/components/Skeleton.js`**:
    - **Purpose**: A new reusable component created to display a shimmering, animated placeholder.
    - **Rationale**: This replaces jarring "Loading..." text with a visually appealing skeleton screen that mimics the layout of the content being loaded. This is a modern UX pattern that improves perceived performance. It is used in the dashboard.

- **`frontend/components/LandingPage.js`**:
    - **Purpose**: The public-facing landing page.
    - **Modifications**:
        - The content was updated to reflect the application's full feature set (Resume Parser, LinkedIn Bio Generator, etc.).
        - Staggered entrance animations were added to the hero section and feature cards using `framer-motion`.
    - **Rationale**: To make a stronger first impression on new users and clearly communicate the value proposition of the app.

### Application Pages
- **`frontend/app/dashboard/page.js`**:
    - **Purpose**: Displays the user's saved content.
    - **Modifications**:
        - The simple "Loading Dashboard..." text was replaced with the new `Skeleton` component, creating a skeleton layout of the dashboard grid.
        - Staggered animations were added to the content cards so they animate into view gracefully.
    - **Rationale**: To provide a seamless loading experience, preventing layout shifts and making the page feel faster.

- **`frontend/app/login/page.js` & `frontend/app/signup/page.js`**:
    - **Purpose**: User authentication entry points.
    - **Modifications**:
        - The "Log In" and "Sign Up" buttons now have an animated loading state. When a user submits the form, the button text is replaced by three animating dots.
    - **Rationale**: To provide clear visual feedback that the authentication request is in progress, preventing double-clicks and assuring the user that the system is working.

- **`frontend/app/page.js` (Generator Page)**:
    - **Purpose**: The main application page for generating content.
    - **Modifications**:
        - The "Generate" buttons now have an animated spinner icon when `isLoading` is true.
        - A `ResultSkeleton` loader is now displayed while waiting for the AI-generated content to arrive.
    - **Rationale**: To provide immediate feedback for user actions and to fill the empty space during generation, making the wait feel more active and less frustrating.

## ❗**Mandatory Directive for Future Development**❗

**The next agent MUST strictly adhere to the existing architecture, patterns, and libraries established in this project.**

- **Consistency is Key**: All new components and features must match the existing visual style (TailwindCSS), animation style (`framer-motion`), and coding patterns (React hooks, component structure).
- **No New Libraries without Cause**: Do not introduce new major libraries or frameworks (e.g., a different state manager, a different styling library) without a compelling, documented reason and ensuring it doesn't conflict with the existing stack.
- **Follow the Leader**: Before writing any new code, inspect the existing, relevant files (`LandingPage.js`, `dashboard/page.js`, `Skeleton.js`, etc.) to understand and replicate the established patterns for state management, component structure, and animations.
- **Animations**: All new animations should be implemented using `framer-motion` to maintain a consistent feel across the application.
- **Loading States**: All new data-fetching operations must implement a proper loading state, preferably using the reusable `Skeleton` component or a button-specific animation as seen in the login/signup forms.

Adherence to these guidelines is critical for maintaining the project's quality, consistency, and long-term maintainability.
