# Gemini CLI Interaction Log: Telegram Scraper Feature

## Objective
Build a backend worker to scrape job listings from the "freelance_ethio" Telegram channel and save them to the Supabase database.

### Key Interaction 1: Initial Scaffolding
- **Prompt:** Asked to create the database schema for a `jobs` table, scaffold a `worker/` directory with `scraper.py` and `config.py`, and populate the files with initial logic for connecting to Telegram and the database.
- **Outcome:** Generated SQL and Python code.

### Key Interaction 2: Debugging `NoSuchTableError`
- **Problem:** The script failed because the `jobs` table didn't exist in the database.
- **Prompt:** Asked the CLI to provide the clean SQL command again.
- **Outcome:** Provided the correct `CREATE TABLE` statement, which was then executed successfully in the Supabase dashboard.

### Key Interaction 3: Debugging `ArgumentError: got None`
- **Problem:** The scraper script failed to load the `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file due to an unreliable relative path.
- **Prompt:** Instructed the CLI to modify `worker/config.py` to use `pathlib` to construct a robust, absolute path to the `.env` file.
- **Outcome:** The fix was applied correctly, and the configuration loaded successfully.

### Key Interaction 4: Debugging `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'worker'`
- **Problem:** The script failed because of an incorrect package-style import (`from worker.config...`).
- **Prompt:** Instructed the CLI to change the import to a direct relative import (`from config...`).
- **Outcome:** The fix was applied, and the script's import logic now works correctly.

### Current Status
- The scraper script is fully coded but is currently stuck at the initial Telethon client login step. The next action is to debug why the Telegram login code is not being received.
