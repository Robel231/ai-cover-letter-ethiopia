# Gemini CLI Interaction Log: Telegram Scraper Feature

## Objective
Build a backend worker to scrape job listings from the "freelance_ethio" Telegram channel and save them to the Supabase database.

### Key Interaction 1: Initial Scaffolding
- **Prompt:** Asked to create the database schema for a `jobs` table, scaffold a `worker/` directory with `scraper.py` and `config.py`, and populate the files with initial logic for connecting to Telegram and the database.
- **Outcome:** Generated SQL and Python code.

### Key Interaction 2: Debugging `NoSuchTableError`
- **Problem:** The script failed because the `jobs` table didn't exist in the database.
- **Prompt:** Asked the CLI to provide the clean SQL command again.
- **Outcome:** Provided the correct `CREATE TABLE` statement, which was then executed successfully in the Supabase dashboard.

### Key Interaction 3: Debugging `ArgumentError: got None`
- **Problem:** The scraper script failed to load the `DATABASE_URL` from the `.env` file due to an unreliable relative path.
- **Prompt:** Instructed the CLI to modify `worker/config.py` to use `pathlib` to construct a robust, absolute path to the `.env` file.
- **Outcome:** The fix was applied correctly, and the configuration loaded successfully.

### Key Interaction 4: Debugging `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'worker'`
- **Problem:** The script failed because of an incorrect package-style import (`from worker.config...`).
- **Prompt:** Instructed the CLI to change the import to a direct relative import (`from config...`).
- **Outcome:** The fix was applied, and the script's import logic now works correctly.

### Current Status
- The scraper script is fully coded but is currently stuck at the initial Telethon client login step. The next action is to debug why the Telegram login code is not being received.

## Objective: Build the "AI Interview Coach" Feature

### Key Interaction 1: Backend Scaffolding (Question Generation)
- **Prompt:** Asked to create a new protected endpoint `/api/generate-interview-questions` that takes a CV and job description and uses a specialized AI prompt to return a JSON object containing an array of tailored interview questions.
- **Outcome:** Successfully created the new Pydantic models and the FastAPI endpoint.

### Key Interaction 2: Frontend Scaffolding (UI Page)
- **Prompt:** Instructed to create a new dynamic page at `/interview-coach/[contentId]`, protect it, and have it fetch the necessary data to call the new question generation endpoint and display the results. Also requested a button on the dashboard modal to link to this page.
- **Outcome:** Created the new page but initially failed to add the button to the dashboard, which was corrected in a subsequent step.

### Key Interaction 3: Debugging `async/await` Bug
- **Problem:** Encountered an `AttributeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'choices'` in older endpoints.
- **Prompt:** Instructed to audit all AI-related endpoints in `main.py` and ensure they were all defined with `async def` and used the `await` keyword for the Groq API call.
- **Outcome:** The bug was successfully fixed across all endpoints.

### Key Interaction 4: Debugging Data Flow (`405` and Logical Errors)
- **Problem:** The interview coach page failed, first with a `405 Method Not Allowed` and then with a logical error about missing job descriptions.
- **Prompt:** Diagnosed the need for a `GET /api/content/{content_id}` endpoint and a data structure change to save original CV/JD text. Instructed the CLI to add the new endpoint and modify the database schema and save-logic accordingly.
- **Outcome:** Successfully implemented the new endpoint and data structure, fixing the flow.

### Key Interaction 5: Building the Interactive Feedback Loop
- **Prompt:** Instructed to build the final part of the coach: a new endpoint `/api/analyze-interview-answer` to provide JSON-formatted feedback, and to integrate the `useSpeechRecognition` hook on the frontend for an interactive experience.
- **Outcome:** Successfully implemented the full, interactive mock interview feature.

### Key Interaction 6: Solving API Rate Limiting (`429 Error`)
- **Problem:** The powerful "Job Matcher" feature was hitting the Groq API's TPM rate limit.
- **Prompt:** Instructed to add a small `asyncio.sleep(1.5)` delay inside the job matching loop in `main.py` to gracefully handle the rate limit.
- **Outcome:** The fix was successfully implemented, solving the scaling issue.

## Recent Interactions (August 11, 2025)

### Telegram Scraper Automation & Robustness
- **Action:** Added logging and error handling to `backend/worker/scraper.py` for improved robustness and operational feedback.
- **Action:** Temporarily replaced `backend/worker/scraper.py` with a minimal login script to force a new Telegram session file creation, addressing the "User is not authorized" error.
- **Action:** Reverted `backend/worker/scraper.py` back to its full, robust version after the session file was successfully created.

### Backend API Health Check & CORS Fixes
- **Action:** Added a `GET /` endpoint to `backend/main.py` for health checks, returning `{"status": "ok", "message": "Welcome to the AI Job Tools API!"}`. This addresses `404 Not Found` errors for the root URL.
- **Action:** Temporarily opened CORS (`allow_origins=["*"], allow_origin_regex` removed) in `backend/main.py` for debugging purposes to diagnose persistent `400 Bad Request` (CORS) errors.
- **Action:** Reverted the CORS configuration in `backend/main.py` back to the secure version using `allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"]` and `allow_origin_regex=r"https://ai-cover-letter-ethiopia.*\.vercel\.app"` after debugging confirmed the regex was correct.
